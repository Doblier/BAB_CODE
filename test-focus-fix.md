# Focus Fix Test

This file is to test that the focus management fix works correctly.

## Test Steps:

1. Open this file in the editor
2. Type some text here
3. Switch to another file (like index.html)
4. Type some text there
5. Switch back to this file
6. Verify that the cursor stays in this file and doesn't jump to index.html

## Expected Behavior:

- When you switch between files, the focus should stay in the file you're currently viewing
- The cursor position should be preserved when switching back to a file
- Typing should work in the currently active tab without jumping to other files

## Test Results:

- [ ] Focus stays in current file when switching
- [ ] Cursor position is preserved
- [ ] No unwanted focus jumping to index.html
